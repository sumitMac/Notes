# Core Components =>
React Native includes a few dozen components which can be used out-of-the-box. More complex components can be built by combining the core components in interesting ways.

<View>
It is often used to create layout structures for other components.
It has number of props that can be used to control its appearance & behavior.
<View> uses flex-box layout by default.
Which makes it really easy to control how its child components are laid out within the container.

Views are the most basic building block of React Native apps. The View is an abstraction layer on top of the target platform's native equivalent:

For iOS - UIView
For Android - android.view
For Web - <div>

<TouchableOpacity>
If you're looking to create a button or another interactive element that fades
in opacity when pressed, you can use
TouchableOpacity Component.
Think of it like a cousin to the Button component in React but have more room for =>
Customization Flexibility


Flatlist
Which is used for rendering a long list of items that need to be scrolled efficiently
It's like the map function in React

Map use for small list.

<ScrollView>
its like overflow scroll in html

<SafeAreaView>
The purpose of SafeAreaView is to render content within the safe area boundaries of a device. It is currently only applicable to iOS devices with iOS version 11 or later.
