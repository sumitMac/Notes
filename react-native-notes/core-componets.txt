# Core Components👇
React Native includes a few dozen components which can be used out-of-the-box. More complex components can be built by combining the core components in interesting ways.

View 👇
It is often used to create layout structures for other components.
It has number of props that can be used to control its appearance & behavior.
<View> uses flex-box layout by default.
Which makes it really easy to control how its child components are laid out within the container.

Views are the most basic building block of React Native apps. The View is an abstraction layer on top of the target platform's native equivalent:

For iOS - UIView
For Android - android.view
For Web - <div>

TouchableOpacity 👇
If you're looking to create a button or another interactive element that fades
in opacity when pressed, you can use
TouchableOpacity Component.
Think of it like a cousin to the Button component in React but have more room for 👇
Customization Flexibility


FlatList 👇
Which is used for rendering a long list of items that need to be scrolled efficiently
It's like the map function in React

Map 👇
use for small list.

ScrollView 👇
its like overflow scroll in html

<SafeAreaView>
The purpose of SafeAreaView is to render content within the safe area boundaries of a device. It is currently only applicable to iOS devices with iOS version 11 or later.

Text 👇
is used to render text. Unlike on the web, text must be wrapped in a <Text> component.

Image 👇
is used to render images. Images may either be downloaded from the web, or imported as files, which are then bundled with the app.

# point
Layout works differently for images downloaded from the web and those imported as files.

Imported images: the image file is scanned at build-time, and the image's dimensions are included as metadata in the app bundle. The dimensions of an Image component are then set to image's dimensions by default.
Images from the web: the dimensions of the image aren't known at build-time, so the width and height of the Image are set to 0 by default. In order for the image to show up on the screen, we need to either set the width and height or a flex value in the style of the Image. If the dimensions are known ahead-of-time, then they may be passed in the source prop along with the uri.

Syntax👇
   <Image
      style={styles.image}
      source={{ uri: '' }}
    />

 Button 👇   
 We use the Button component when we want to show a button using the default/standard style for each native platform.

Button is convenient, but not very configurable, so if we want to customize the style beyond the color, we'll typically use Touchable components instead.

Syntax👇
 <Button
        title={'Your btn name'}
        onPress={your code}
      />
